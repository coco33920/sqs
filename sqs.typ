Yul awoke at the sound of her old school vintage alarm clock, today was the day,
she graduated from the Federation Space Science Academy yesterday she was
officially Dr Yul Klid, PhD in Astrophotometry.

Officially ? Well no she was Dr _deadname_ Klid, PhD in Astrophotometry, and it
was exhausting, she didn't looked like a girl so she never outed herself to the
government and changed name. She was worried, why? No idea bigots were a thing
of the past and the Federation had all the necessary medical technology to
transition she just... never got the guts to do it and now she will be trapped
on a space station more than ten thousands light years from home and will not be
able to transition...

Anyway, she had a transport to catch, she listed her checklist for the last time
in their head. Her clothes? Check. Her cute clothes she never worned? Check.
Diploma? Check. Health supply? Check. Everything is okay and she's ready to take
her station at the *cough* the _Deep Space Station for Scientific and
Engineering research n°1_ it's really a mouthfull.

One suitcase, that's all, all her memories, stories, personnal belongings,
clothes, for a _lifetime_ was in _one_ suitcase. She would like to say goodbye
to someone but... no one was left on earth. She had no friends from the Academy,
her parents died more than a decade ago, no familly, no one. She could leave
Earth and no one would miss her there. She hoped the station was better...
