*ring ring ring*\
Yul awoke at the sound of her old school vintage alarm clock, today was the day,
she graduated from the Federation Space Science Academy yesterday she was
officially Dr Yul Klid, PhD in Astrophotometry.

Officially ? Well no she was Dr _deadname_ Klid, PhD in Astrophotometry, and it
was exhausting, she didn't looked like a girl so she never outed herself to the
government and changed name. She was worried, why? No idea bigots were a thing
of the past and the Federation had all the necessary medical technology to
transition she just... never got the guts to do it and now she will be trapped
on a space station more than ten thousands light years from home and will not be
able to transition...

Anyway, she had a transport to catch, she listed her checklist for the last time
in their head. Her clothes? Check. Her cute clothes she never worned? Check.
Diploma? Check. Health supply? Check. Everything is okay and she's ready to take
her station at the *cough* the _Deep Space Station for Scientific and
Engineering research Alpha-Kappa-Two_ it's really a mouthfull.

One suitcase, that's all, all her memories, stories, personnal belongings,
clothes, for a _lifetime_ was in _one_ suitcase. She would like to say goodbye
to someone but... no one was left on earth. She had no friends from the Academy,
her parents died more than a decade ago, no familly, no one. She could leave
Earth and no one would miss her there. She hoped the station was better...

#middle

She had her own shuttle, a gift from the government for young graduates who
don't have families anymore. She had the pleasure of naming it and she chose the
_USS Ada Lovelace_ after an old earth woman who was considered to be the first
programmer more than three hundred years ago. It was a class-5 private shuttle
but attached to the Federation Fleet, and thus have an official number, _USS Ada
Lovelace, FSN-$657 kappa$_. It was capable of achieving speed up to 50 light
years an hour at cruising speed, the transit will be a bit over 8 days.

Vessels of the Federation uses a kind of FTL travel called "Space Distorsion
Transportation" she was not an engineering but she roughly remembered it
warped space in front of the vessel and generates a pathway out of micro-worm
hole to slip through space thousands the time of speed of light without being
subject to relativistic effects.

Being alone in the shuttle meant all role but piloting was up to her, the
computer will pilot, she was a good but fairly inatentive pilot, thansk to ADHD.
she began the pre-launch sequence start and contacted Paris air control, who was
the station for this side of earth. She was in vacation in a family home a few
dozens kilometers south of Bordeaux.

- Lieutenant Klid to Paris Air Control, this is the Lovelace FSN-$657 kappa$ my flight path was uploaded to your server this morning requesting permission to lift off in a path to low earth orbit

- Paris Air Control, request granted, flight vector uploaded to your flight computer, please keep following it until you achieve low earth orbit and then switch to the Earth Space Control frequency.

- Lovelace here, copy that, thanks.

Yule then pressed the button to launch the vessel, she felt the launch thrusters
gently lift the vessel off the floor and gently follow the flight vector to low
earth orbit. The flight shield automatically raised and the vessel weapons
activated on standby. The flight plan had portion outside Federation space. So
the computer activated automatically the low alert.

#middle

The flight was pleasing until achieving low earth orbit, it was a bit over an
hour, and she could see Earth becoming smaller and smaller, she always marveled
at the view, nothing could be so magical. When low earth orbit was achieved a
_bip_ could be heard inside the cockpit.

- USS Ada Lovelace FSN-$657 kappa$ to Earth Space Traffic, in low earth orbit 500 km above Earth, request permission to switch to sublight, leave the planetary system and activate SDT drive. 

- Earth Space Traffic, you can leave the system on the $sigma$ route and
activate SDT drive once you've cleared the orbit of the moon, EST out.

- Copy that, see you on the other side.

Yule pushed the coordinates for the $sigma$ route and activated sublight. A few
minutes later she passed the orbit of the moon and said "Activate SDT,
authorization Yule-Kappa-Delta-673". She felt the reaction of the shuttle as the
space was constricted, mangled and distorted and the shuttle slipped on the
first wormhole. The exterior was familiar, everything was as seen through a fish
eye lens.

= Part 2

The _Ada Lovelace_ dropped out of FTL in the Layoidora system, where the _Deep
Space Station for Scientific and Engineering research Alpha-Kappa-Two_ is
located, at the edge of Federation Space, doing front of the line new research
about science. Yule was really excited to be there, after 8 days of boring
travel she was on the verge of arriving at her new assignment, Junior Researcher
in Astrophotometry.

- This is Lieutenant Klid, Aboard the _USS Ada Lovelace FSN-$657 kappa$_, a new arrival in the Astrophotometry laboratory hailing the _Deep Station Alpha-Kappa-Two_ to request docking clearance.

- Lieutenant! You can dock your shuttle in the staff bay. Activating tractor beam.

- Copy that.

#middle

A few minutes later after she docked her precious shuttle in the staff bay she
was in the main lobby of the station. It was _not_ like she thought it would be,
she was awaiting a white futuristic immaculate station and not this homey
station. The main room was maybe a hundred metre wide circle with some cafés,
sofas, chairs, observations decks, all with colours, and marked with utilisation
over time, mood lighting over some reading areas with plants were here and
there, and finally, _Flags_, just _Flags_.

There were flags, _everywhere_, she spotted the trans flag at least thrice, the
non binary flag, the intersex flag, the pansexual flag, polyamourous flag, etc.
A lot of flags, this station was.... Open-minded.

Yule did not hear someone walking up to her.

- Hey lieutenant! 

Yule was surprised and quickly threw a salute to the officer which seems to be
the captain of the station

- No need this much formality lieutenant, I'm Captain Flaik but you can call me
Aria, of the station, on behalf of the crew welcome to _SQS_. The _Space Queer Station_. As you've seen we're very... queer here and you're welcome to explore your gender and sexuality here, we have doctors on board and people to talk about. Your section is special, you will see!

- Okay, captain, Aria, it's not what I imagined but this is *fantastic* I think I'll be able to transition here, she finished mumbling in her own voice.
